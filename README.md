# what2pick
League of Legends champion pick helper

## Live hosted version (takes some time to launch):
https://what2pick.herokuapp.com/

## Purpose
what2pick helps you to choose a champion based on teammates and enemies in your match.
Algorithm takes into consideration synergies with other lanes and counters to other champions. Naturally a counter to champion on your lane is valued more than counter to another lane.
Also, the algorithm suggests which champions you should avoid to play.

## Usage
Select a role where you intend to play. Then, as the other players choose their picks, input them in the app. With every new entry, app will re-calculate the best picks. 
You can change the role anytime you want to suggest picks for your teammates.
